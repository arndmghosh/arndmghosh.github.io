I am a Research Scientist at 3M Health (Solventum) in the Speech Research and Development group. Our overall aim is to develop AI-driven healthcare solutions that leverage speech and natural language processing (NLP) technology to automate clinical visit workflows for physicians, allowing them to focus more on patient care.

Specifically, I am working (or have worked) on:
- Self-supervised learning (SSL) for speech
- Transducer (RNN-T) based ASR models
- End-to-end joint ASR and speaker-role prediction
- Confidence calibration of neural networks
- Low-resource, low-footprint wake-word detection
- Summarization of doctor-patient conversations
