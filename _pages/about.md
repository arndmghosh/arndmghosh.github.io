I work as a Research Scientist at 3M/Solventum Health in the Speech R&D group. Our primary aim is to create AI-powered healthcare solutions that leverage speech and natural language processing (NLP) technology to automate clinical visit workflows for physicians, allowing them to focus more on patient care. Specifically, I have worked/working on wake-word models, self-supervised learning (SSL) for speech, transducer (RNN-T) based ASR models, end-to-end speaker/role-prediction ASR, summarization of doctor-patient conversation, confidence calibration of machine learning models etc.
