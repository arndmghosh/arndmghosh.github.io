I am a Research Scientist at 3M Health (Solventum) in the Speech Research and Development group. Our overall aim is to develop AI-driven healthcare solutions that leverage speech and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to automate clinical visit workflows for physicians, allowing them to focus more on patient care.

Specifically, I am working on (or have worked on):
- Self-supervised learning (SSL) for speech
- Transducer (RNN-T) based ASR models
- End-to-end joint ASR and speaker-role diarization
- Confidence calibration of neural networks
- Low-resource, low-footprint wake-word detection
- Summarization of doctor-patient conversations

**Education:**
- 2019–2019: Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, USA
- 2009–2013: Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering, NIT Durgapur, India
