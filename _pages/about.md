I am a Research Scientist at 3M/Solventum Health in the Speech R&D group. Our overall aim is to develop AI-driven healthcare solutions that leverage speech and natural language processing (NLP) technology to automate clinical visit workflows for physicians, allowing them to focus more on patient care.

To be specific, I am workiong (or have worked) on self-supervised learning (SSL) for speech, transducer (RNN-T) based ASR models, end-to-end speaker/role-prediction ASR, confidence calibration of neural networks, low-resource low-footprint wake-word
detection, summarization of doctor-patient conversations etc.
