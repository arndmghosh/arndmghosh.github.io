I am currently a Research Scientist at 3M Health (Solventum) in the Speech Research and Development group. Our overall aim is to develop AI-driven healthcare solutions that leverage speech and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to automate clinical visit workflows for physicians, allowing them to focus more on patient care.

**Research:**
- Machine Learning (2019 - present)
  - Core ML: Confidence calibration of neural networks [**NeurIPS 2022**]
  - Speech: Self-supervised learning, Transducer (RNN-T) ASR, Joint ASR and Speaker-Role Diarization [**Interspeech 2025**], wake-word detection [**Interspeech 2022**]
  - NLP: Summarization of doctor-patient conversations [**EMNLP 2021**]
- Wireless Communication (2012 - 2018)
  - Interference modeling in wireless networks [**IEEE Comm. Letters 2017, 2018**]
  - Error correction and ARQ schemes for underwater wireless sensor networks [**Sensors 2013**]
  - Signal modulation for free-space optical communication [**IEEE SPCOM 2014**]

**Education:**
- 2019–2019: Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, USA
- 2009–2013: Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering, NIT Durgapur, India
