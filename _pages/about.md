I am currently a Research Scientist at 3M Health (Solventum) in the Speech Research and Development group. Our overall aim is to develop AI-driven healthcare solutions that leverage speech and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to automate clinical visit workflows for physicians, allowing them to focus more on patient care.

**Research:**
- Machine Learning (2019-present)
  - Core ML: Confidence calibration of neural networks (NeurIPS)
  - Speech: Self-supervised learning, Transducer (RNN-T) based ASR, Joint ASR and speaker-role diarization, wake-word detection (Interspeech)
  - NLP: Summarization of doctor-patient conversations (EMNLP)
- Wireless Communication (before 2019)
  - Interference modeling in wireless networks (IEEE Comm. Letters)
  - Error correction and ARQ schemes for underwater wireless sensor networks (Sensors)
  - Signal modulation for free-space optical communication (IEEE SPCOM)

**Education:**
- 2019–2019: Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, USA
- 2009–2013: Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering, NIT Durgapur, India
