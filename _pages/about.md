I am currently a Research Scientist at 3M Health (Solventum) in the Speech Research and Development group. Our team's research is focused on developing AI-driven healthcare solutions that leverage advanced speech and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to automate clinical visit workflows, enabling doctors to reduce documentation burden and focus more on patient care.

**RESEARCH:**
- Machine Learning (2019 - present)
  - Core machine learning: Confidence calibration of neural networks, reliable and trustworthy AI (**NeurIPS 2022**)
  - Speech: Self-supervised learning; Transducer-based ASR; Joint ASR and Speaker-Role Diarization (**Interspeech 2025**); low-resource, low-footprint wake-word detection (**Interspeech 2022**)
  - NLP: Automatic summarization of doctor-patient conversations (**EMNLP 2021**)
- Wireless Communication (2012 - 2018)
  - Interference modeling in wireless networks (**IEEE Communication Letters 2017 and 2018**)
  - Error correction and automatic repeat request (ARQ) schemes for underwater wireless sensor networks (**Sensors 2013**)
  - Signal modulation schemes for free-space optical communication (**IEEE SPCOM 2014**)

**EDUCATION:**
- Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering, **Carnegie Mellon University**, USA (2019 - 2019)
- Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering, **NIT Durgapur**, India (2009 - 2013)

**REVIEWER:**
- Reviewer for IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP) 2026
- Reviewer for Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2025 (**Top Reviewer** award)
- Reviewer for INTERSPEECH 2025
- Reviewer for IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT) 202
